You can control which UI is shown when the user is signed in or signed out using Convex's <Authenticated>, <Unauthenticated> and <AuthLoading> helper components. These should be used instead of Clerk's <SignedIn>, <SignedOut> and <ClerkLoading> components, respectively.

It's important to use the useConvexAuth() hook instead of Clerk's useAuth() hook when you need to check whether the user is logged in or not. The useConvexAuth() hook makes sure that the browser has fetched the auth token needed to make authenticated requests to your Convex backend, and that the Convex backend has validated it.

If the client is authenticated, you can access the information stored in the JWT via ctx.auth.getUserIdentity.

If the client isn't authenticated, ctx.auth.getUserIdentity will return null.

Make sure that the component calling this query is a child of <Authenticated> from convex/react. Otherwise, it will throw on page load.
